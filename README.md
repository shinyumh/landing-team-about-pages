# College Collab - landing page, team page, and about page
*06/23/2020*

Here are the landing page, team page, and about page for College Collab. This respository includes three different files, one for each page. Since these pages were built from a HTML template, there might be excessive and/or redundant codes, files, or images in every file. The graphics on every page is designed by me, so if you want to change anything about the graphics, I can edit them or share the files with you via Canva!

The dark square in the middle of the landing and about pages are meant to be **a screenshot of the College Collab student portal**, but since I couldn't get the dimensions correct, I would really appreciate if you could add that. Some other things that still need to be edited include...
- add link for the "sign up now" button
- edit the links in the footer
- add information for the team page

Let me know if anything seems off. Feel free to change any code and/or element!
